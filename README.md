created a hard coded database which includes username and password,
created a timeline array includes username and their written post(only text in string)
the logic is--> it ask for the username and password from ther user through prompt
and the program takes the username and password and checks in the database for the match
if it matches the database username and password than timeline gets displayed else
it throw the error message..That's it :)
